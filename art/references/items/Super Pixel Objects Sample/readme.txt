Hello! Thank you for downloading the Super Pixel Objects Sample asset pack. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- The root folder has three outline subdirectories, which sort the objects by outline style. Inside each of those outline folders, you will find descriptively-named folders for each object and each animation.

- You'll notice that some assets have animation! Animation is indicated by filenames like "frame0000.png", "frame0001.png", and so on.
	- The recommended frame duration for most animations is 15-20 FPS.

Any questions?
Email me at contact@untiedgames.com and I'll try to answer as best I can!

-Will
