        Evaluate all deciders attached to this state and determine whether the enemy should transition into another state.

        Process:
        1. Ask each decider for a list of possible decisions (with score/priority).
        2. Collect all candidate decisions into a single list.
        3. Find the highest priority among all candidates.
        - This ensures that "safety" or "critical" decisions (like no ground) always override less important ones (like choosing an attack).
        4. From the candidates in that priority tier, pick one using weighted randomness based on their score.
        - Higher score â†’ higher probability of being chosen.
        5. If a best decision is found, exit the current state and enter the new one with any parameters provided.

        Example:
            - EdgeDecider returns "wait" (priority 10, score 90).
            - AttackDecider returns "jump_attack_pre" (priority 5, score 80).
            => "wait" will be chosen, since it has higher priority.
