//Uploader's Notes


It took many hours, but I sat down and scrubbed, cut, & organized a total of 826 sounds from
the original 99 tracks of the Hannah Barera Lost Treasures Sound Effects Library volume 5.

The emphasis was on short, quick cuts that are better suited for sound effects in
games. There's a few "long" versions of certain tracks, and certain tracks can be looped
(that are labeled as such). I did what I could to label each sound appropriately, but
you might want to institute your own as naming system since naming sounds is a very
tangential sorta thing.

Enjoy the sounds!

Hanna-Barbera Lost Treasures Sound Effects is a CD of great royalty free
sound effects from the classic cartoons and superheroes of the 60s and
the 70s. This collection of over 350 priceless cartoon sounds, many of
which have not been heard or used in more than twenty-five years, have
been digitally re-mastered to create the newest addition to the
Hanna-Barbera Sound FX Library. Just like the rest of the collection,
many of these timeless sound effects have been produced by legends in
the business like Bill Hanna, Joe Barbera, and sound designers Greg
Watson and Pat Foley. With roots that date back to the Golden Age of
Hollywood and the MGM Studios of the 1940s, these cartoon sounds truly
reflect the efforts of some of the most creative talents of the modern
era – Hanna-Barbera Lost Treasures Sound Effects.
