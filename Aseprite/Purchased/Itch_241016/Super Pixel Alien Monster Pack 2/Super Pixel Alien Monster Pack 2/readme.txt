// HOW TO USE THIS ASSET PACK //
////////////////////////////////

Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders named PNG and spritesheet.

- The PNG folder contains all the characters separated into their own folders. In each character folder, you will find subfolders for each animation containing the frames as individual PNG files.

- The spritesheet folder contains all the effect animations separated into their own folders, but with the frames packed into a single image. A metadata file is alongside each spritesheet which may be used to parse the image.

- Recommended animation FPS: 15 (66.7 ms/frame)
