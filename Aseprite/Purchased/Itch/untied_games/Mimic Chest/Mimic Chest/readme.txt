//HOW TO USE THIS ASSET//
/////////////////////////

Hello! Thank you for downloading the Mimic Chest asset pack. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders corresponding to each color style for the character.

- In any of the style folders, you will find a folder named PNG. This folder contains folders of individual PNGs representing each animation for that character in that style.

- In the style folders, you will also find a folder named spritesheet. This folder contains the spritesheet for the character animations in the corresponding color style as well as a metadata file for parsing the spritesheet.

- Recommended animation FPS: 15

Any questions?
Email me at contact@untiedgames.com and I'll try to answer as best I can!
