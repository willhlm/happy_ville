# Intro Pacing & Narrative Onboarding — Design Summary

## Design Goal
Transform the intro from Scripted Loss → Restart into Cause → Consequence

The inferno should feel like a future revealed, not a fake beginning.

We do NOT need two full world states.
We only need a convincing local illusion around the statue area.

## Target Player Experience
1. Something is wrong in the forest
2. I learned to defend myself
3. I discovered a mystery
4. I witnessed a catastrophe
5. I survived it
6. The journey continues

## Final Opening Flow

### Phase 1 — Uneasy Exploration (0–2 min)
- Player starts playable immediately in forest
- Subtle unnatural elements (wind direction, silent animals, ashen particles)
- No text, no NPC, no explanation

Goal: Curiosity before lore

### Phase 2 — Natural Ability Discovery (2–3 min)
- First attack emerges through interaction (break object / disturb corpse)
- Small enemies defeated
- A blocked path establishes future return goal

Goal: Agency before narrative

### Phase 3 — The Trigger (3–4 min)
- Player reaches statue
- Environmental warnings:
  - audio dampening
  - particles drawn inward
  - enemies avoid area

Player chooses to interact

Goal: Player causes the event

### Phase 4 — Future Vision (Inferno)
NO FADE TO BLACK

Forest visually transforms around player:
- colors drain
- ash falls
- ground cracks
- background swaps

Player keeps control at all times

Goal: Same timeline, different state

### Phase 5 — Boss Encounter
- Player survives briefly (20–40 sec)
- Difficult but readable attacks
- Player believes survival is possible

Outcomes:
Lose → expelled back to forest
Win → secret ending (game completed)

Goal: Outcome feels earned

### Phase 6 — Return
Player stands at same statue location
Forest now calm and normal

No wake-up animation
No immediate dialogue
No safe hub

Goal: Continuity preserved

### Phase 7 — Post-Event Exploration
Player continues 2–4 rooms alone

Only AFTER curiosity forms → NPC appears and explains fragments

Goal: Answer questions the player already has

## How to Fake “Time Shift” Without Two Worlds

We only change a small radius around the statue area.

### Technique A — Layer Swap
Have 3 tile layers:
- normal
- corrupted
- inferno

Swap only nearby chunks during transition

Player assumes entire world changed.

### Technique B — Background Authority
Players judge world state mostly by:
- sky color
- particles
- lighting
- audio

Changing these globally sells the illusion even if tiles stay same elsewhere.

### Technique C — One-Way Knowledge
Block backtracking for the first minutes after return:
- collapsed tunnel
- locked gate
- fog barrier

Player cannot compare states → illusion holds

### Technique D — Enemy Reinterpretation
Same enemy sprite, different palette/behavior

Player perceives different timeline with minimal work.

---

## Critical Rules
- Never fade to black during the shift
- Never remove player control
- Never give explanation immediately after event
- Never place safe hub right after return
- Always let player act before story

---

## Secret Ending Requirement
If player beats boss:
- Do NOT return them to normal start
- Show consequence immediately
- Credits or altered world state

Victory must not merge with defeat path

---

## What This Fixes
The player no longer waits for the game to begin.

Instead they feel:
I already started — and something happened

This increases perceived pacing dramatically without changing movement speed or combat.
